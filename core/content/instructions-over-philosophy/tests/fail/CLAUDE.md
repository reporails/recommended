# Project Instructions

## Code Quality

Clean code is important because it helps to maintain the software over time.
Well-structured code enables better collaboration among team members.
The reason we follow coding standards is for long-term maintainability.

## Testing

Testing is important because it helps to catch bugs before they reach production.
A comprehensive test suite allows you to refactor with confidence.
The philosophy behind test-driven development is that tests guide design.

## Error Handling

Proper error handling enables better debugging in production environments.
Good logging helps to trace issues through the system quickly.
The reason we use structured errors is for consistency across services.

## Architecture

Microservices architecture allows you to deploy services independently.
Event-driven design enables loose coupling between system components.
The philosophy of our architecture is separation of concerns at every level.

## Git Workflow

Feature branches are important because they isolate changes from main.
Code review helps to catch issues early in the development process.
The reason we squash merge is for a clean commit history.

## Documentation

Good documentation is important because it reduces onboarding time.
Keeping docs in sync with code helps to prevent knowledge gaps.
The reason we document APIs is for external consumer clarity.
