# Live External References

Instruction files containing URLs SHOULD only reference accessible resources, because agents may attempt to fetch or recommend dead links to users

## Pass / Fail

### Pass

~~~~markdown
## Resources

- [React docs](https://react.dev/reference)
- [Testing guide](https://vitest.dev/guide/)

(Both URLs return 200)
~~~~

### Fail

~~~~markdown
(File does not exist at expected path)
~~~~

## Limitations

Some URLs require authentication or return different status codes from automated requests vs browsers. Rate limiting may cause false positives. Intranet URLs will always appear dead from external checkers. Check should use HEAD requests with reasonable timeout.
