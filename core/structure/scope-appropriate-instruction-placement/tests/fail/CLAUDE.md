# Root CLAUDE.md
- Python 3.12, use type hints everywhere
- Run pytest before committing
- API endpoints must return Pydantic models
- React components use hooks, not class components
- Database migrations use Alembic
- Frontend tests use Playwright

(Everything in root — API rules load during frontend work, frontend rules load during backend work, wasting context)
